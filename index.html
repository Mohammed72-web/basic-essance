<h2>hello to my book about bodybuilding thats 
    going to make you from a begginer to a guy
    <br>
    who has a very decent physic we will toghter understand 
    the ideas of bodybuilding mostly to the very essence to it
    why do we train why do we sleep and finally why do we eat
</h2>
<hr>
<h1>first lets discuss the 3 pillars of body building </h3>
<h1>(Sleep , Food , Training)</h1>
<h3>we will discuss each pillar and how usful it is and why you CAN NOT! 
focus on 2 and leave the 3rd</h3>
<hr>
<h1>SLEEP</h1>
<h3>sleep is the first pillar of body building which we will discuss 
    without it we wont be able to grow our muscles if not we will lose muscles
    why sleep is important you ask? because sleep is the tool that repairs muscles
    in workouts espically if you realize most people go to train for 1hour why not
    5hours 6hours etc becasue what you are doing there is tearing down your muscles
    yes you heard me right you are tearing down your muscles and in sleep when you
    muscle is tired from the workout and all those microtears happenes
    inside the muscle as you can see in the video 
</h3>
<hr>
<video controls src="how muscles grow.mp4" width="150">
</video>
<hr>

<h3>    as you can see in the video those muscle tears
        while the video is usful tho its wrong because those muscle
        tears happenes not like 100 muscle tear or something
        no its in the millions so the muscle can get teard up evenly
        and will trigger the body's natural growth mechanism to
        repair those tears and then! you grow more muscle size
        since the body's brain thinks "ohh since the muscles are tearing
        that means im fighting a stronge animals out there so i have
         to make more muscles in order to be stronger and survive"
         thats why the muscles gets bigger and here is the worst thing that could happen if you have
         bad sleep or innconsistant sleep like sleeping one day at 8pm 2nd day 11am then 3am etc
</h3>
<h3>soo during sleep you repair your microtears inside the muscle
    and also besides muscle 
    When your sleep schedule keeps changing:

    ❌ Cortisol ↑
    ❌ Testosterone ↓
    ❌ GH ↓
    ❌ Deep sleep ↓
    ❌ Recovery ↓
    ❌ Protein synthesis ↓

    Result:
    👉 slower muscle growth
    👉 more fat gain, more inflammation, lower energy
    👉 weaker workouts
    <hr>
    <h2> Quick note: if you want to get a consistant sleep schedule then you need to  follow this list down below</h2>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>vitamin D by going into the 8am sun without a T-shirt and pants and do that for at least 30minutes
    that will alert your brain that it is day   time and you should NOT sleep at that time
        </li>
        <li>ALWAYS make sure NOT sleep at time more like try to wake up at specific time like 7am
    or 3am which is considered the best sleep 8pm-3am  and if you slept at 3am and woke up at 7am then you
    have to bare as much as you can to not sleep or take a nap ill repeat DO NOT! take a nap because
    you will instantly go into deep state of sleep
        </li>
        <li>no phone 1hour before bedtime no dont listen to those people who says "aww it is okay to use your phone
    without the blue light just use yellow light" DO NOT! listen to those people because what they dont understand
    its not more about your brain knowing it is day or night it is more about your brain having 0 dopamine
    yes you heard me right dopamine and scrolling through your phoen is what causes you to not sleep so read a book
    like bible or quran or any type of book try praying or meditating go eat something orgnize your room do ANYTHING except
    touching your phoneS   
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

<h4> now ill explain what are Cortisol Testosterone GH </h4>
<h1>Testosterone </h1>
<h3>is the hormone that is producde by the male's body mostly
    by testicals unlike females who producde this hormone in very small amounts using the ovaries and adrenal glands
    and the adrenal glands are spongy yellowish stuff above the kidneys thats where they get most of their Testosterone
    and this hormone helps alot in building muscles espically in the male's body thats why
    you see gorilla's tigers or even regular humans with more testosterone has more muscles
    than the avrage guy and testosterone also helps in building muscles even tho muscle is made of 100%
    protine you ask but how does it work ill tell you it works like this "Amino acids = bricks
    Testosterone & GH = construction managers
    Your DNA = blueprint" so testosterone 
    1 boosts the rate at which your muscle cells build new proteins.
    2 Lowers muscle protein breakdown
    3 makes you stronger or more of an animal/beast to lift heavier which will stimulates the growth mechanism
    leading into more muscle fibers breakdown
So you keep more of the muscle you build.
</h3>
<hr>

<h2>IGF-1 </h2>
    <h3>this hormone is produced by muscle cells unlike gh which alot of people mistaken
        thinking IGF-1 is same as gh but its not gh comes from the brain menwhile IGF-1
        comes after training by the muscles and IGF-1 tells the muscle cells to grab the amino acids
        and use them as bricks to not only repair themselves but also make the muscle bigger 
        so in summary (muscle cells producde IGF-1 , IGF-1 tells muscle cells what to do
        which is repairing themselves)
    </h3>
    <hr>

<h2>Cortisol</h2>
    <h3>Cortisol is the worst enemy to a body builder it is the hormone that makes the muscle fibers
        destroy themselves and not  in a good way it burns the muscles and makes it harder to Recover
        stuff that triggers Cortisol (waking up , bad mode , training for more than 1hour , anger)
        thats why you see some bodybuilders hurry as soon as they wake up to meditate or pray so they 
        lower the cortisol and the reason cortisol rises it is because it wakes up the body so the worst 
        thing you could do to your body is not sleeping for a small amount of time it is sleeping for long
        period of times because that will trigger cortisol which 
        will destroy your body because your brain dosent care about the muscles your evolutionary brain cares about
        waking you up to feed your family to go hunt before the night comes in and if you are addicted to masturbation
        then try as much as you can to not feel bad after masturbation because thats what triggers cortisol to alot
        of the young teens out there BUT if you are trying to go on diet  like mr.olympias who want 3-1% body fat
        then you need a lot of cortisol and lactic acid in your body by training for more than 1hour a day 
        like 2 3 or even 4hours a day and then spend the rest on burning fat wil that burn muscles? yes of course but will it burn
        fat? yes and alot of fat will be burned during that proucess and dont worry because ill tell you about
        something called muscle memory which will literally help you gain all the muscles you lost during thats
        hard diet in at least 1 month but make sure to take a lot of days off because your primary focus is to
        recover as much muscles as you can and try to be discpliend on your diet or you will gain fat
    </h3>

<h1> now that we discuss sleep it is time to go into Nutrition and Training
</h1>
<hr>
<h1>Nutrition</h1>
<h3>       when it comes to nutrition then we have to ask ourselves what even is nutrition
    it is eating and feeding yourself alot of food and eating the diffrent types of food like
    carbs protine and finally good fat we will dive deep into basic nutrition and how each one works
<h2>how does nutrition gets absorbed</h2>
<h3>food goes from our mouth to Esophagus → Food pipe 
    The esophagus is just a “tube” that: squeezes food downward 
    using muscle waves (peristalsis) drops it into your stomach
    You don’t digest anything here — it’s just transport.
    and using the pipes it goes to the stomache which will realse an acid 
    depending on the type of food you eat protine carbs etc and this acid will brake protine carbs
    into liquid form and that liquid  form will be mixed of course with the stomache acid from here 
    the stomache will open like a valve only squirting out the acid + liquid nutrition and as soon that happenes
    the the acid is neutralized instantly in the small intestine and from that the liquid nutrition will
    brake into (carbs = glycogen, protine = amino acids good fat =fat fragments) which will go to the liver and it will acts as a filter to
    filter nutrtions and from that they will go to bloodstream  
</h3>
<h2>Carbs , Protine , Good fat</h2>
<hr>
<h1>Carbs🍚</h1>
<h3>carbs is one of the most understood nutritians a lot of people think are just food that makes you
    fat but they are wrong about carbs carbs mostly comes from rice , potatos 
</h3>
<image src="rice.png" width = "100">
</image> 
<h3>and it goes to the stomache turns into stomache liquid and into the intestine to turn into glycogen
    now once it enters bloodstream it will go to the muscles  now glycogen have 2 functions inside the muscle
    the first  is to pump that muscle the more you eat carbs like rice the more the muscle will be fulled with glycogen
    which will leads to make it seem bigger and have bigger muscles and the 2nd is to have more energy inside your muscle
    which makes you a beast inside the gym by this recipe you will have energy "you do cardio as a warm up as soon
    as you hit the gym ---> you will gain oxygen which will get in your bloodstream ----> it will burn the glycogen
    using the Mitochondria or the energy cells ----> it will then turn into glucose and that glucose  and into the atp the final
    form of energy that Mitochondria produces cells it will turn into energy" Now the important part
    if you dont warm up using cardio machines your Lactic acid which will be combined with glucose
    in need to produce energy since you are lifting weight and it will destroy your body since lactic
    acid will burn your muscles unlike oxygen 
</h3>
<hr>
<h2>how much you need carbs?</h2>        
<h3> the recent studies shows that you need carbs depending on your body weight ratio</h3>
<h3>   bodyweight * 6 = carbs(gram)</h3> 
<img src="potato.jpg" width="100" height ='150'>
</h3>
<h3>water</h3>
<h3>now try to drink gallon or 2 of water everyday sips and Do NOT i repeat Do not drink it at once
    no! slowly drink water like if you have a cup of water sip it 3 times to finish it not drinking it all at once
    because that is unhealthy because drinking water causes shock to the heart thats why i recommend to sip it 
</h3>

<hr>
<h1>Protine🍳🍗🍖</h1>
<h3> protine is the main source of muscles or the flesh you are building  it goes to the stomache
    then to the small intestine and turns amino acid now WATCH OUT you need diffrent types of protine thats why alot of people dont recommend penut 
    butter because it dosent  has that much amino acid buildling your muscles is like a lego you need diffrent shapes
    colours to build one thats why you need more than 1 source of protine eggs red meat sardine each has diffrent types of
    amino acids that you need to put in your diet in order to have a balanced diet with good amount
    of amino acid 
</h3>
<hr>
<h2>how much protine you need?</h2>
<h3>now just like carbs there is a specific amount of protine you need to feed your body
</h3>
<h3>body weight * 2</h3>
<h3> now if you dont have that much money remember you can always buy cans of sardine
    or if you are really broke then you can buy chicken legs which is a great source of protine
    and most people even throw the chicken legs in the trash since nobody buys them and you can
    literally get free protine source
</h3>
<h3> be careful tho you cant eat more than 40gram of protine in 1 meal you neeed to keep eating
    throughout the day</h3>
<hr>
<h2> now we will talk a little bit about fat</h2>
<h3> there isnt really to talk about fat except a few tips and how fat works in general
    fat gets absorbed by the body and not every fat is bad there are saturated fat  like sunflower oil which has high amount of  omega 6 and thats why people say its bad because if there is alot 
    of omega 6 in the body and you dont have that much of omega 3 then it will lead to proplems in health tho you can use good oils like butter olive oil coconut oil use them to fry stuff but if you want real good fat then they come from 2 meals that will transform your body espically the 2nd one first thing is the eggs you see this yellow in the egg? it contains a lot of good fat and thats what you mostly want to eat unlike the egg white which dosent contain oils except the protine in the white of the egg you suppose if you have gut proplem to not eat more than 3 egg yolks but if you dont have any proplems then its fine eat as much as you want but dont eat more than 6 the 2nd snack i recommend is diffrent types of nuts  before going to bed this will increase your mass building by alot because the thing about fat is fat is what makes testosterone and most of the hormons so when you eat nuts before bed you are going to boost your testosterone alot more than double the amount of testosterone you have and all of that just by eating  literally 10grams of mixed nuts 
<hr>
<h2>now I present to you a couple of great tips and ideas
    that will help you in your journy in becoming a decent looking bodybuilder
</h2>
<h3>first thing we will talk about is when to eat because a lot of people eat their
    carbs and protine and go 4 or even 5horus without eating because thats one of the worst 
    things you could do espically if your body type is endomorph  you need to eat every 2hours
    because if you dont you will slowly lose muscles "quick tip if your body is endomorph  then NEVER
    ruin your sleep schedule" so now the time that you eat every 2-3hours
</h3> 

<h3>   
    make sure your meals are small 
    and try as much as you can to never feel full because if you did you have ruined your insulin for the day
    and you might not eat for alot of time  which will slowly not only make you not eat enough calories
    but also make your body burn a little bit of muscles
</h3>
<pr> 
    the evolutionary human's stomache wasnt desgined to handle
    6 meals or even 7 meals it was handled to take 2 meals a day which meaans you as a body builder
    will have kind of unhealthy intestines and unhealthy stomache thats why i advice you to fast 
    every 3 months for 2weeks at least fast for 2weeks and not eating alot of stuff and when you finish your
    fast after that try to make your meals as small as possiable and dont train hard because you will 100%
    lose muscle your goal in that fast to make your body healthy and try to do a bit of cardio so you also
    lose fat which will make your absorbtion better give you better shape 
     and always remember "the best bodybuilders are NOT who you see on the stage
     the best bodybuilders are the one who takes bodybuilding as a healthy life style
     and look decent during the years"
</pr>

<h1> now that we talked about nutrition we talked about sleep we will talk about training
     and this part is going to make you understand everything about training and most of the 
     philosphies of diffrent trainers like mike mentzr jay cutler tom platz and others and infact
      if you follow each rule you can just go to the gym and choose the exercises you want yourself
       in that day without needing of a course because you will be writing your own course and you 
       will know why we even train this exercise and that exercise💪🏻
</h1>
<hr>
<h1>Whats the point of training</h1>
<h3> as we discussed this earlier the point of doing specific movment is to streach
    the muscle fibers which will lead to small cuts in the muscle that will grow after 
    proper nutrition and sleep and the reason we do workouts like benchpress is because
    that chest muscle needs to be activated since the muscle fibers alighens with the position
    to push the weigh you cant use your chest while doing dumble curls exercise because all the stress
    is going to go to the bieceps since the muscle fiber of the biceps are alighened
    with the stress factor which is the weighted dumble
</h3>
<img src="Screenshot 2025-12-03 152505.png">
<h3> as you can see in the picture the biecep's muscle  is aligened to be straight
    making the fasted muscle to twitch and gets flexed is the bieceps because it is the most
    sensetive to that position of the weight or the stress now you might ask me "but mohammed isnt
    the forearm also alighened with the biecep fibers?"  i will tell you YES indeed but you are lifting
    and curling the weight which might flex the forearm a little bit but it will mostly flex the bieceps
    that when you need to do some type of teqnuiqe like doing 3 second rep or stop mid rep then continue
    so you can strenghten the mind muscle connection to the bieceps and use most of the bieceps
</h3>
<hr>
<h1>Squeaze stretcg the 2 basics that if you understand them you will be a king in bodybuilding</h1>
<h3><h1>squeaze(pump) </h1>  what does that mean and what do these 2 things do so lets start slowly
    what does a muscle need? stress factor + cuts to motivate the growth mechanism to triggers inside
    the body so lets talk about squeaze and what does it mean   by squeazing first we basically squeaze
    we will take for example the quads leg extension now the reason we do leg extension
<ul>
    <li>pump blood inside the muscle which will lead to bigger better 
        looking quads</li>

    <li>make the quads muscle flex so no other muscle will take over the exercise like a little
        bit of the hammstring or a little bit of the lower back so the quads will 100% have the stress
        facotor layed upon them making that quads hard as a rock and as soon as any sign of streach
    appears it will instantly make huge amount of cuts </li>

    <li>make oxygen reach there so the recipe becomes complete to burn carbhydrates because as we
        discussed earlier oxygen + carbs = proper energy</li>
    <li>the joint wont get any engery if you squeaze the quads the right way because the muscles
        is whats going to be taking over not the joint 
    </li>
</ul>
</h3>
<h1>stretch</h1>
<h3> now that we talked about squeazing you are ready to do the 2nd exercise stretch
    like doing the tom platz streach</h3>


<img src="quad strech.png" width="100" height="100"> 
<img src="qad.png" width="100" height="100">
<h3> as you can see in the picture espically the 1st picture tom platz 
    isnt squeazing the muscle because it is already hard as a rock  he is stretching the muscle 
    using his extreme exercise and we can take the same thing with arnold
    he bench press squeazing his
    chest then he goes and does dumble flies as you can see thhe following video and you can skip
    to the end and see arnold himself saying that he intentionaly goes hitting the ground

</h3>
<video controls src="untitled.mp4" width="200" height="200"></video>
<h3>beware tho a lot of people will tell you to not do it because it might
    tear your chest but dont let anyone tell you what to do if you keep doing chest flies maximum 12.5kg 
    each dumble and never go more you will nearly never tear your chest  
</h3>
<hr>
<h1>the muscles you should train and on what stage you should train
</h1>
<h1>begginer</h1>
<ul>
    <li>middle part of the chest</li>
    <li>bieceps and triceps</li>
    <li>front and side shoulder</li>
    <li>lats and uppper traps</li>
    <li>quads hamstring</li>
</ul>
<h3>now you see as a begginer you need stronge weight to cut your muscle fibers thats when 
    you do (12 10 8)reps 3 sets becauses your goal is to increase your strenght not to  build muscles
    so when you increase the strenght for every muscle you can finally effectivly do stretch exercises
    with proper weight so you tear your muscles and build more  next morning thats why you must do
    12 10 8 reps by increasing the weight every set and the reason i will make you train only these 
    muscles is becasue if you dont build your middle part of the chest you wont be able to build
    the upper one since you dont even have the basic muscle mid part which will lead you only getting
    shoulder injury if you try to build your upper chest and the reason i didnt make you build your
    lower chest because when you have genaticly a smal chest(most of people like 95% have that) your chest
    will go forward then goes down which will make you look you got a big lower chest even tho you wont train
    it and same thing with other musclles you need to train your basic muscles first and then do 
    the more smaller muscles
</h3>
<h1>intermediate</h1>
<h3> now you as an intermediate bodybuilder you probably have trained your strenght
    and also builded some muscles so what you need to train are more specific muscles 
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>chest ,  upper chest </li>
    <li>front/side/back shoulder</li>
    <li>forearms bieceps triceps brachials</li>
    <li>quads calvs hammstring and inner/outer thighs glutes</li>
    <li>abs (side abs WARNING: DO NOT USE ALOT OF WEIGHT BECAUSE YOU WILL MAKE YOUR WAIST LOOK BIG AND BLOCKY
        THERFOR YOU ARE NOT GOING TO ACHIVE THE V SHAPE)
    </li>
    <li>back upper traps and middle traps </li>
</ul>
<h3>as a intermediate you have the strenght and good amount of muscles
    now you need to make your body more symitrical and have a good shape thats why i focused more
    of important muscles that not only will add size but details to your body such as back shoulder or
    abs your reps will depend on each type of muscle unlike the begginer who needs 12 10 8 if you
    are in the intermediate league then completely and i mean it completely forget about 
    12 10 8 do NOT do it anymore since you wont need strenght you need size and more little defintion
</h3>
<h1>Now we will talk about each muscle and how you can train them the proper way</h1>
<h1>Chest!</h1>
<img src="samir.png"
<h3>1. Chest Anatomy
    The chest has three main regions: upper, middle, and lower.</h3>
    <h3>2. Training the Upper Chest

If your upper chest isn’t growing, it often means your training technique is wrong.

Starting your workout with upper-chest exercises can cause your front shoulders to take over, because:

Front delts are sensitive,

They may dominate the movement, especially if your mind-muscle connection is weak.

Beginners should start with basic/middle-chest exercises first unless they have:

Good muscle control,

Enough strength.</h3> 
<h3>3. Machine Chest Press (Hammer Strength)

Modern chest machines have a slightly tilted grip.

Old machines didn’t have this tilt.

To use them correctly:

Align the tilt angle of the grip with the angle of your elbows.</h3>
<h3>4. Bench Press Tips

Beginners should focus on bench press or machine press to build strength.

Grip width changes chest focus:

Narrow grip → more outer-chest emphasis

Wide grip → more middle-chest emphasis

Lowering the bar near the upper chest/neck increases:

Stretch

Chest activation
(But careful — this variation can stress the shoulders.)</h3>
<h3>5. Rest & Recovery

Real recovery depends on intensity.

If you train extremely hard, chest soreness can last 3–4 days.

Typical recommendation: train chest once a week for beginners.</h3>

<h3>6. Exercise Selection for Beginners

Beginners should avoid the pec deck machine:

Hard to feel the chest without existing muscle.

Choose exercises based on chest shape/goals:

Rounded chest → dumbbell flyes

Triangle-shaped chest → dips

Fat around lower chest or armpit area → pullovers</h3>

<h3> now the main exercises for the chest are
    1 incline/bench press "squeazing exercise"
    2 incline/dumble press "squeazing exercise"
    3 dumble flies "squeazing exercise"
    4 pull over "squeazing exercise"
    5 dips "streaching exercise"
</h3>
<h3> you as a begginer should only train 2 exercises 1st squeaze 2nd stretch</h3>
<h3> you as a intermediate should only train 3 exercises 1st squeaze 2nd also squeaze 
    for your upper chest then stretch</h3>
<h3>you as an advance should do 5 exercises after all you are looking for defintion not mass</h3>
</h3>
<h3>the recommended chest reps are 12 - 12 or 10 - 10 for intermediate
     but for begginers you always must do 12 10 8
<hr>
<h1>Shoulders</h1>
<img src="kevin front (1).png"widt="250" height="250"> 
<br>
<img src="back ke in.png" widt="250" height="250">
<h3>so shoulders are a unque muscle that is the 2nd biggest muscle in your body
</h3>
<h3>1. shoulder Anatomy
    
    the shoulder has 3 parts front shoulder side shoulder and back shoulder
<br><br>
    2. you should ALWAYS start your shoulder with back shoulder then side shoulder and finally front shoulder

    or the oopisite because if you start with the side shoulder then move on to the other parts of the shoulder
    you are just wasting your energy 
    <br><br>

    3. the shoulder reps should always be -20  reps shoulder is more like an evolutionary muscle like legs
    that are evolutionary made for high reps And sets and needs alot of work so it needs a  good amount of reps with light weight
    because the intensity of the shoulder should be  even stronger than legs Yes! you read that right the shoulders
    are suppose to be the 2nd most biggest muscle and it needs an insane amount of effor and even with all that effort
    you wont even reach 60% of the amount of intensity you need this is not a quote to motivate you its 
    the truth that shoulder day should be that hard
    <br><br>
    
    4. if you manage to get a big shoulder you would see the defintion of your chest lats and triceps not alot of people
    have big shoulders and only unique bodybuilders wold have big shoulders since shoulders are soo annoying and hard to train
     if you have back shoulder it will seperate the triceps and lats from the shoulders and it will  make these muscles
     look much defined and if you trian your side shoulder and front shoulder it will make your chest more defined 
    <br><br>
    
    5. shoulders need a full day for themselves you might add a small muscle traps or bieceps but need add it with
     back or chest or any other muscle reason 1 if you add it with back or chest the joint would 100% get injured just 
     imagine the amount of stress you are putting it upon the joint and if you put shoulders with leg day you are training the 
     2 most biggest muscles in your entire body and no matter the volume or intensity and effort you put in you will NEVER
     reach the required intensity unless you are a begginer im talkin about intermediate and advance 
     because as i said begginers must only focus on 12 10 8 because they want to increase their strenght first
     so they can tear down the muscle fibers and when they reach a good amount of strenght then they can go into an intermediate course
     <br><br>
     6. the amount of exercises required to stimulates growth is (begginers: 1e for front shoulder , 1e
     for side shoulder )intermediate(2e for front shoulder , 2e for side shoulder 2e for back shoulder)
     
    <br><br>
    
    7. best exercises to work on shoulders (dumble press(front , squeaze) 
     
     , front dumble flies(front , it can act 
     as a squeazing exercise if you pause as soon as you reach the postive rep and acts as a stretch exercise if you
     loewr the dumbles slowly)
<br><br>
      , triceps push downs(front ,  a VERY stronge stretch exercise)
<br><br>
     seated side flies(side , squeazing exercise ) 
<br><br>
     , standing flies(stretch exercise but make sure to resist the weight when 
     lowering the dumbles) 
<br><br>
     , wide grip rowing debout(side , also a Very stronge stretch exercise
     for the side shoulder but make sure to resist the weight when lowering the bar) 
<br><br>     ,
     peck machine (back , squeaze try to slowly do the postive rep to sqeuaze the muscle)
<br><br>
     seated rear delt flies(back , stretch)
</h3>

     <h2> now before i finish talking about shoulder id like to say that all of the flies movment could be turned
    into a squeazing or a stretching exercise if you know when to pause its just to show you that
    you dont need to thing that every exercise must be a squeazing exercise its showing you that
    you can minipilaute any exercise   and make it a squeazing/stretching exercise

<h1>Bieceps / Triceps </h1>

<h3> when it comes to triceps and bieceps the workout is going to be a bit unique
    although there is not much to talk about bieceps and triceps <br><br>
    1. Triceps Anatomy triceps are 70% of the arm a lot of people think that they need to train biceps to have 
    an arm that fulls out the shirt but you are wrong you need to train your triceps and not the biceps
    espically the long head 
    <br><br>
    <img src='tri.png'>
    <br>
    <br>
    2. when making your own course when you train your triceps/bieceps try to train them 2 times a week
    first time 3 workouts for triceps 2 bieceps 2nd time 1 workout for triceps and 1 one for bieceps
    and make sure to do a full range of motion and make the period of the exercise very intense
    <br><br>
    3. a lot of people when they train their triceps during skull crusher using a bar or a dumbbell overhead triceps extension
    make sure to not press the dumble forward No press that dumble lift it backward behind your head 
    not on top of your head <br>> when doing triceps push down do Not train like mr.olympias or like 
    jay cutler where they bend over and start pressing the weight down 
    he does that not because of ego lift but because if he dosent bend over the weight will send him 
    flying backwards so he has to bend so he dosent fall on the ground but you as an intermediate or a begginer
    you need to  have a perfect form with light weight 
    <br><br>
    <img src="jay-cutler-triceps.gif" height="250" width = "250" >
    <img src="ha (1).png"height="250" width = "250" > <img src="ha (2).png"height="250" width = "250" >
<br><br>
    you as a begginer/intermediate you should do 3 exercise for triceps and ill list you 
    those 3 exercises that you need to do (triceps push downs skull crusher triceps dips)
    now when you do triceps dips make sure to not feel the stretch on your chest you should feel
    a deep stretch in your front shoulder and triceps and keep doing that the sets as intermediate 
    should be 3 sets push down 2 skull crusher and 2 for triceps dips if you train intensly enough
    but if you trained in a way that is not that intense then add some volume and add another set
    to your triceps dips since its the best stretch and the only stretch workout in this mini course
    that i just gave you now we will talk about biceps
</h3>
    <h3>Bieceps Anatomy
        <br>1. the bieceps has 2 heads long head short head both of them can be trained with one exercise
        now when people do bieceps workout the reason their bieceps dosent grow is because they love
        training their bieceps they love doing that so they overtrain their bieceps by doing too many
        sets or reps or even exercises
        <br><br>2. when people do bieceps workout they dont do a full range of motion which is the worst thing
        that you could do espically to a small muscle like the bieceps make sure to go all in and do a full
        range of motion with hard intensity
        <br><br>3. when training the bieceps you better do some techniques that you should do every time you finish
        your course for every muscle and espically the bieceps like the pause rep pausing 3 seconds
        after finishing your postive rep and you have another technique 3 postive  3 seconds negative rep
        which means the rep will last 6 seconds or you have drop set 
        <br><br>4. there is no squeaze / stretch exercise espically in bieceps because all the exercises with a good
        range of motion would stretch out your bieceps except 1 exercise that is made for stretching your bieceps
        and it is the preacher and dont worry about all those people who say you will tear your bieceps with
        full range just do it with a good amount of weight try to do 2 forced reps during preacher and the second 
        exercise that is considered to be the best exercise for the bieceps is chin ups or close grip palms up pull down
        which is the best exercise when training bieceps because it does both squeazing the muscle and stretching the muscle

<h1>Back</h1>
<img src="l (2).png" height ='150' width=150>

<h3>now talking about the back it is one of the most unique muscles in the body
    that are the  hardest to train but and infact a lot of people train the back wrong
    so we will see first the back anatomy 
</h3>
<br>
<img src="aaaaf.png" height ='150' width=350> 
<br>
<h3> now as you see in the picture the so called "back" is literally nearly 35% of the real Back
    but what a lot of people dont get is those are called the lats now you might as me well what 
    is the rest of the back i will tell you it is indeed the traps yes those as you see in the picture are
    traps middle traps and lower traps which makes nearly another 35% of the back and these are
    the muscles that make your back denser and more shaped we will talk about traps after we finish
    talking about the lats now lets get on how to train the lats
    <br><br>
    1 when training lats you should do as a begginer 3 exercises for the lats
    and as an intermediate you should do 4 exercises too for the lats the reps
    for the intermediate should stay 10 - 12 rep on every workout  now you as a begginer
    should do the basic workouts and you might find this suprising but you dont need to feel the lats
    during workout because you first need the strengh to gain unlike an intermediate of course if you
    dont feel your lats during workout then you are doing something wrong and i will tell you
    EXACTLY what it is 
    <br><br>2 the  mistakes for intermediate when training lats is "i dont feel it but the coach said
     keep going so im just gonna keep doing the same" NO you can not do such a thing your lats 
     is a whole muscle like your chest if you dont feel your chest will you after finishing workout
     say that was a nice workout? no of course not you would hate it because you didnt feel your chest
     and same thing with your lats you MUST feel your muscle durng workout by enhancing your mind
     muscle control to the next lever
     <br><br>
     3 mind muscle control is a way of connecting the lats muscle lets take this rowing exercise

     for example
     <br><img src="l (3).png" height="150" width="250"> <br>
     it is the best exercise for the lats because it gives you a huge mind muscle connnection and 
     by feeling that "(pulling with your lats not your bieceps or wrist)" yes thats the magic words
     that you needed to feel your lats pull with your lats every exercise this rowing exercise you see?
     imagine pulling with your lats even if you close your eyes for better imagination and yes i do this 
     and feel my lats wayy much more so keep that in mind in every exercise you do <ul> <li>1 keep perfect 
     form 2 do the workout very slowly like </li><li>2seconds postive rep 3 or even 4 seconds negative rep</li></ul>
     and imagine that you are pulling with your lats im keeping saying the same thing because pulling 
     with your lats is that important and yes doing nearly 4 to 5 sets for that exercise would be better 
     for you and try to keep your lats stressed and do more like of half reps to keep that mind muscle 
     control note(your elbow only need to reach your torso or lats and thats it you dont need to 
     go further to get more squeezing because that isnt your lats pulling it will be more your bieceps
     )
     <br><br>4 lats flexing: during any time of the day even if you are wakling make sure to flex your 
     lats muscels looking wider keep doing that practice and make it a habit every time you do something 
     because that will really get your lats mind muscle stronger and also a bit of posing wont hurt
     espically the lat spread that will really make your mind muscle stronger and getting more used
     to feeling your lats</h3>

     <hr>
     <h3>traps </h3>
     <img src="back ke in.png"height="150" width="250">
     <h3> now traps arent really that commplex it has 3 parts upper middle lower
        traps are much like the calvs so you need to train your traps with light weight and then
        stronge weight so you can stretch your traps 
        so we need literally 6sets for traps and you as an intermediate should train traps 
        3sets shrugs works 80% upper 20% and then shrugs on a bench 45 degree that will work the 
        back traps and then you want to do another set of shrugs BUT! with as much as 100kg weight 
        or 50kg dumble each hand you dont need to go heavier because this weight is enough to breake the fibers 
        so and try to use a technique like squeeze 3seconds after finishing postive rep and then go slowly 
        on the negative  and thats it all about traps reps should be 10 - 14 
        much more like calvs
     </h3>

<h1>Legs </h1>
<img src="legstom.png"height="150" width="250">
<h3>1 now legs the biggest muscle that needs an intensity nearly as much as shoulders and you mostly
    have seen how tom platz train legs thats how hard YOU should as an indivisual train your legs
    and shoulders yes ill specify talking about shoulders because it is a perfect chance here to remind
    you how intense you should train your shoulders more and harder than legs anyway legs anatomy
    we will be disscusing the hammstring and quads and finally calvs 
    <br><br>2 quads now we should tarin ALWAYS quads with leg extension because quads muscle needs to be 
    first before the squat or  lunges because these 2 exercises will hurt your knee soo bad and 
    make your knee joint injured 100% and you CAN NOT tain them as the first exercise because your
    quads muscle IS NOT sensetive so you need to train leg extension first because so the muscle
    gets flexed first and Then your knee wont be injured that way so always start with leg extension ALWAYS
    <br><br>3 legs is an evolutionary muscle nearly like the shoulders where it requires 15+ reps reaching
    even 30 reps and sets cant be less than 5sets per exercise like leg extension and no matter how
    hard you train always new fibers will get squeezed because legs is like that a new fiber works 
    when the last one is tired and it keeps going thats why you cant walk on your hands like your legs
    because legs has this special evolutionary thing about them which is recruiting new fibers to
    work when the last one is tired thats why no matter how hard you train your leg extension you need
    another set because the legs still hasnt used all the fibers in it and then you can stretch them
    with the squat and lunges
    <br><br>4 hammstring there isnt much to talk about hammstring except that people dont know how to 
    stretch their hammstring propely they think laying leg curls can just do the work but we all
    know we need a squeezing exercise(leg curls) stretching exercise (deadlift) yes deadlift
    is the exercise you need to stretch your hammstring ill put a gif here for the hammstring deadlift
    <br><br><img src="e80d14528c2588241f7439958a805809.gif" width = '200'height='200'><br><br>
    <br><br>5 try as much as you can to push your glutes muscle back as further as you can because thats
    what really stretches the hammstring and dosent activates the lower back at all!
    <br><br>6 calvs now try training calvs by doing literally 1 exercise yes just like the traps muscle
    you need to train calvs by doing standing leg raises with medium weight the reps gonna be 
    12-14 dont go past that and squeeze at the top and now you want to go nearly full stack (the
    last set )if you can handle that and hold the weight as much as you can  and when you feel 
    you are falling then start jumping giving a HUGE stretch to those calvs thats what people
    dont understand they always call calvs muscle a stubborn but by doing that you would make 
    your calvs huge and prove that the only stubborn muscle their body has is their unEducation brain
    muscle <br>

<h1>now that we finished talking about every muscle every nutrition we will talk   
    about fat how you gain fat  you gain fat and how to get rid of fat
</h1>
<h3> so  when the human body in an evolutionary way stores fat because they will be  energy source
    and believe it or not fat is the primary energy source but we humans in the modren days we live of carbs
    and surger which the body uses the carbhydrates first and then runs on fat so when doing a diet
    you will notice that yea it is hard BUT you are literally getting rid of posion inside your body 
    you are getting rid of a lot of posion in the guts like the unprocessed protine in the guts 
    and making your body increasing growth hormone nearly 5times and you will feel kinda happy and good because
    you are supporting your brain cell by running on fat or ketosis and it has wayy too much health 
    benfits that i wont talk about because this book is about bodybuilding and not health benfits 
    so when your body runs on ketosis it is what makes your fat gets burned as an energy by not 
    eating any carbs or suger and just eating minerals such as sodium potassium magnesium and iron
    and we cant forget about protine by eating this diet right here "3 boiled eggs with salt
    , 1 can of sarden and getting a potas pil " then you have the perfect diet plan BUT be aware
    that you need first before dieting you need to slowly increasing cardio so when you fast you wont 
    be soo tired that you cant do even half an hour run  and i really prefer to not do HIIT cardio
    because it will require david goggin's discpline and unless you are a beast then yes you can 
    do 30minutes HIIT cardio and lose 5kg in a month (from expirance) but it requires discpline which
    is something 99% of all people dont have even adults you might say going to gym is discpline but no
    you are having fun at the gym not going there because you know it will benfit you and you can 
    stop any time but doing whats not fun while not being forced is discpline you will need it in a diet
    but you can just walk for an hour and that should do the work another thing about exercising during
    diet is you need to train more than 30rep for every muscle until you feel your muscles are burning
    and thats where yourr training starts keep going dont stop when you feel the burn because you are
    spot reducing the fat(yes it is not a myth) you are burning your muscles and fat but dont worry
    in just 1 month you will gain all the muscles back due to muscle memory so yes do a bunch
    of reps DONT do stretching exercises and make sure during diet to not eat suger if you can 
    do it do it and dont keep changing your mind thats a sign of ADHD changing your mind oh ill diet
    nvm ill stop and start bulking and keeps going that is the worst thing that you could do 
     and if you are a man of work who has a family on their back and a lot of work then trust me you 
     dont need a gym you dont need any of that you need just 1 thing just eat a salad and if not avaliable
     then drink cold cup of water before EVERY meal and look how much weight you gonna lose and if you can
     slowly cut off sugers and carbhydrates and bread in a month look how much you gonna lose weight.
