<h2>hello to my book about bodybuilding thats 
    going to make you from a begginer to a guy
    <br>
    who has a very decent physic we will toghter understand 
    the ideas of bodybuilding mostly to the very essence to it
    why do we train why do we sleep and finally why do we eat
</h2>
<hr>
<h1>first lets discuss the 3 pillars of body building </h3>
<h1>(Sleep , Food , Training)</h1>
<h3>we will discuss each pillar and how usful it is and why you CAN NOT! 
focus on 2 and leave the 3rd</h3>
<hr>
<h1>SLEEP</h1>
<h3>sleep is the first pillar of body building which we will discuss 
    without it we wont be able to grow our muscles if not we will lose muscles
    why sleep is important you ask? because sleep is the tool that repairs muscles
    in workouts espically if you realize most people go to train for 1hour why not
    5hours 6hours etc becasue what you are doing there is tearing down your muscles
    yes you heard me right you are tearing down your muscles and in sleep when you
    muscle is tired from the workout and all those microtears happenes
    inside the muscle as you can see in the video 
</h3>

<hr>

<h3>    as you can see in the video those muscle tears
        while the video is usful tho its wrong because those muscle
        tears happenes not like 100 muscle tear or something
        no its in the millions so the muscle can get teard up evenly
        and will trigger the body's natural growth mechanism to
        repair those tears and then! you grow more muscle size
        since the body's brain thinks "ohh since the muscles are tearing
        that means im fighting a stronge animals out there so i have
         to make more muscles in order to be stronger and survive"
         thats why the muscles gets bigger and here is the worst thing that could happen if you have
         bad sleep or innconsistant sleep like sleeping one day at 8pm 2nd day 11am then 3am etc
</h3>
<h3>soo during sleep you repair your microtears inside the muscle
    and also besides muscle 
    When your sleep schedule keeps changing:

    ❌ Cortisol ↑
    ❌ Testosterone ↓
    ❌ GH ↓
    ❌ Deep sleep ↓
    ❌ Recovery ↓
    ❌ Protein synthesis ↓

    Result:
    👉 slower muscle growth
    👉 more fat gain, more inflammation, lower energy
    👉 weaker workouts
    <hr>
    <h2> Quick note: if you want to get a consistant sleep schedule then you need to  follow this list down below</h2>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>vitamin D by going into the 8am sun without a T-shirt and pants and do that for at least 30minutes
    that will alert your brain that it is day   time and you should NOT sleep at that time
        </li>
        <li>ALWAYS make sure NOT sleep at time more like try to wake up at specific time like 7am
    or 3am which is considered the best sleep 8pm-3am  and if you slept at 3am and woke up at 7am then you
    have to bare as much as you can to not sleep or take a nap ill repeat DO NOT! take a nap because
    you will instantly go into deep state of sleep
        </li>
        <li>no phone 1hour before bedtime no dont listen to those people who says "aww it is okay to use your phone
    without the blue light just use yellow light" DO NOT! listen to those people because what they dont understand
    its not more about your brain knowing it is day or night it is more about your brain having 0 dopamine
    yes you heard me right dopamine and scrolling through your phoen is what causes you to not sleep so read a book
    like bible or quran or any type of book try praying or meditating go eat something orgnize your room do ANYTHING except
    touching your phoneS   
        </li>
    </ul>

<h4> now ill explain what are Cortisol Testosterone GH </h4>
<h1>Testosterone </h1>
<h3>is the hormone that is producde by the male's body mostly
    by testicals unlike females who producde this hormone in very small amounts using the ovaries and adrenal glands
    and the adrenal glands are spongy yellowish stuff above the kidneys thats where they get most of their Testosterone
    and this hormone helps alot in building muscles espically in the male's body thats why
    you see gorilla's tigers or even regular humans with more testosterone has more muscles
    than the avrage guy and testosterone also helps in building muscles even tho muscle is made of 100%
    protine you ask but how does it work ill tell you it works like this "Amino acids = bricks
    Testosterone & GH = construction managers
    Your DNA = blueprint" so testosterone 
    1 boosts the rate at which your muscle cells build new proteins.
    2 Lowers muscle protein breakdown
    3 makes you stronger or more of an animal/beast to lift heavier which will stimulates the growth mechanism
    leading into more muscle fibers breakdown
So you keep more of the muscle you build.
</h3>
<hr>

<h2>IGF-1 </h2>
    <h3>this hormone is produced by muscle cells unlike gh which alot of people mistaken
        thinking IGF-1 is same as gh but its not gh comes from the brain menwhile IGF-1
        comes after training by the muscles and IGF-1 tells the muscle cells to grab the amino acids
        and use them as bricks to not only repair themselves but also make the muscle bigger 
        so in summary (muscle cells producde IGF-1 , IGF-1 tells muscle cells what to do
        which is repairing themselves)
    </h3>
    <hr>

<h2>Cortisol</h2>
    <h3>Cortisol is the worst enemy to a body builder it is the hormone that makes the muscle fibers
        destroy themselves and not  in a good way it burns the muscles and makes it harder to Recover
        stuff that triggers Cortisol (waking up , bad mode , training for more than 1hour , anger)
        thats why you see some bodybuilders hurry as soon as they wake up to meditate or pray so they 
        lower the cortisol and the reason cortisol rises it is because it wakes up the body so the worst 
        thing you could do to your body is not sleeping for a small amount of time it is sleeping for long
        period of times because that will trigger cortisol which 
        will destroy your body because your brain dosent care about the muscles your evolutionary brain cares about
        waking you up to feed your family to go hunt before the night comes in and if you are addicted to masturbation
        then try as much as you can to not feel bad after masturbation because thats what triggers cortisol to alot
        of the young teens out there BUT if you are trying to go on diet  like mr.olympias who want 3-1% body fat
        then you need a lot of cortisol and lactic acid in your body by training for more than 1hour a day 
        like 2 3 or even 4hours a day and then spend the rest on burning fat wil that burn muscles? yes of course but will it burn
        fat? yes and alot of fat will be burned during that proucess and dont worry because ill tell you about
        something called muscle memory which will literally help you gain all the muscles you lost during thats
        hard diet in at least 1 month but make sure to take a lot of days off because your primary focus is to
        recover as much muscles as you can and try to be discpliend on your diet or you will gain fat

<h1> now that we discuss sleep it is time to go into Nutrition and Training
</h1>
<hr>
<h1>Nutrition</h1>
<h3>       when it comes to nutrition then we have to ask ourselves what even is nutrition
    it is eating and feeding yourself alot of food and eating the diffrent types of food like
    carbs protine and finally good fat we will dive deep into basic nutrition and how each one works
<h2>how does nutrition gets absorbed</h2>
<h3>food goes from our mouth to Esophagus → Food pipe 
    The esophagus is just a “tube” that: squeezes food downward 
    using muscle waves (peristalsis) drops it into your stomach
    You don’t digest anything here — it’s just transport.
    and using the pipes it goes to the stomache which will realse an acid 
    depending on the type of food you eat protine carbs etc and this acid will brake protine carbs
    into liquid form and that liquid  form will be mixed of course with the stomache acid from here 
    the stomache will open like a valve only squirting out the acid + liquid nutrition and as soon that happenes
    the the acid is neutralized instantly in the small intestine and from that the liquid nutrition will
    brake into (carbs = glycogen, protine = amino acids good fat =fat fragments) which will go to the liver and it will acts as a filter to
    filter nutrtions and from that they will go to bloodstream  
</h3>
<h2>Carbs , Protine , Good fat</h2>
<hr>
<h1>Carbs🍚</h1>
<h3>carbs is one of the most understood nutritians a lot of people think are just food that makes you
    fat but they are wrong about carbs carbs mostly comes from rice , potatos 
</h3>
<image src="rice.png" width = "100">
</image> 
<h3>and it goes to the stomache turns into stomache liquid and into the intestine to turn into glycogen
    now once it enters bloodstream it will go to the muscles  now glycogen have 2 functions inside the muscle
    the first  is to pump that muscle the more you eat carbs like rice the more the muscle will be fulled with glycogen
    which will leads to make it seem bigger and have bigger muscles and the 2nd is to have more energy inside your muscle
    which makes you a beast inside the gym by this recipe you will have energy "you do cardio as a warm up as soon
    as you hit the gym ---> you will gain oxygen which will get in your bloodstream ----> it will burn the glycogen
    using the Mitochondria or the energy cells ----> it will then turn into glucose and that glucose  and into the atp the final
    form of energy that Mitochondria produces cells it will turn into energy" Now the important part
    if you dont warm up using cardio machines your Lactic acid which will be combined with glucose
    in need to produce energy since you are lifting weight and it will destroy your body since lactic
    acid will burn your muscles unlike oxygen 
</h3>
<hr>
<h2>how much you need carbs?</h2>        
<h3> the recent studies shows that you need carbs depending on your body weight ratio</h3>
<h3>   bodyweight * 6 = carbs(gram)</h3> 
<img src="potato.jpg" width="100" height ='150'>
</h3>
<h3>water</h3>
<h3>now try to drink gallon or 2 of water everyday sips and Do NOT i repeat Do not drink it at once
    no! slowly drink water like if you have a cup of water sip it 3 times to finish it not drinking it all at once
    because that is unhealthy because drinking water causes shock to the heart thats why i recommend to sip it
